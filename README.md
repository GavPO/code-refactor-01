## Description

Refactoring code for accessibility optimization

The purpose of this assignment was to refactor code for accessibility optimization. During this project I learned that pretty simple html can make pretty nice looking websites, and it mainly just matters what containers they're in. I also learned about Selector Specificity. I think overall this code solves the problem of looking cluttery, and also helps optimize it for search engines.
